Folder Compression Utility
This Python program allows users to compress folders into various compression formats such as zip, tar, and tgz. The compressed files are named according to the selected compression format and the current date. For instance, if the user selects tgz as the compression type and compresses a folder named "MyFolder", the resulting compressed file will be named "MyFolder_YYYY_MM_DD.tgz" where YYYY, MM, and DD represent the current year, month, and day respectively.

Usage
Installation: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Running the Program:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Run the compress.py script using the command python compress.py.
Follow the prompts to select the folder you want to compress and choose the desired compression format.
Available Compression Formats:

zip: Compresses the folder into a zip file.
tar: Compresses the folder into a tar file.
tgz: Compresses the folder into a tar file with gzip compression.
Feedback: The program provides feedback on the success or failure of the compression process, along with appropriate error messages in case of failure.
